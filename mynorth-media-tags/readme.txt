MyNorthMedia changes:
  * localization and taxonomy name adjustments
  * addition of legacy template functions from Media-Tags plugin
  * addition of helper functions
  * addition of new template functions

The license is GPLv3, and we're stickinfg to it. We did not create the base class used in this plugin, just modified existing work, so you are welcome to do the same.

For general FSF/GPLv3 info: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html

A copy of the GPLv3 should exist alongside as license.txt, and if you keep attribution to MyNorthMedia and Frank Bültge we'll send you a...FREE KITTEN!

Note that the GPLv3 does not cover the kitten and we would strongly discourage derivative works. Because...genetics are hard/dangerous.
